# Adding BSEC

Because I'm not sure about the licensing for the BSEC library
(I will ask on the Bosch support forum), I have not included the BSEC library
in the repo right now. You will need to manually add it.

Download the BSEC2 software from Bosch Sensortec, then copy the `bin` and `inc`
folders into this directory.
